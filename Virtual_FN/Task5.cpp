// 5. Vehicle Hierarchy: Develop a base class 'Vehicle' with virtual function 'start()'. Derive classes 'Car' and 'Bike' from 'Vehicle', each with its own implementation of 'start()'. Write a program to demonstrate polymorphism by starting various vehicles (instances of 'Car' and 'Bike') and observing their behavior.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Vehicle{
    
};
